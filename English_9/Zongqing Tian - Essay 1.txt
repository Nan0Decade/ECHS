Over the last few years, technology for germline genetic engineering has been invented and has been proven. Germline genetic engineering is the modification of the genome in the sperm or egg cell such that it is heritable. While other forms of germline engineering have existed for decades, it has been dismissed as ethically not allowed. But with the new invention of the CRISPR/CAS-9 editing, which has been proven with some certainty off success, the debate of whether or not germline engineering is ethically permissible has been sparked. 

Germline genetic engineering works by modifying the genome in the sperm or egg cell. A genome is all the DNA found in a cell. By modifying the genome of a sperm or egg cell, the result is heritable which means the newborn child will have the modified traits.

The specific type of germline genetic engineering has existed every since genome engineering was invented in the 1900s. Though in the past germline genetic engineering on humans has been dismissed as ethically wrong and has even been banned in 70 countries, the new invention of the CRISPR/CAS-9 genome editing method has re-sparked decades-long debate about whether germline genetic engineering should be researched.

Many opposed the idea of research for germline genetic engineering simply because it is too big of a risk. 

There are many views on germline genetic engineering, the side for germline genetic engineering will argue that cancer can be prevent. The possibilities for germline genetic modification if it was tested more could lead to great benefits such as preventing cancer.
